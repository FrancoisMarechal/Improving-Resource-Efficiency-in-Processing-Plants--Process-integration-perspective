\section{Mass Integration}

Analogous to energy integration, it is also conceivable to integrate material streams of a process. Mass as easily converted between forms as is energy which necessitates a slightly altered consideration for improving process integration. Common examples of this practice are for commonly used chemicals or utilities such as hydrogen, water, $CO_2$ or others. The analog between material integration and heat integration is that the flowrate is considered as the analog for heat load and the quality of the material as the analog for temperature. 

\subsection{Hydrogen Network Integration}
As mentioned, hydrogen can be considered as an analog to heat and possesses the following attributes:
